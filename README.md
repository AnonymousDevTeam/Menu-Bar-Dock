Menu Bar Dock places the apps you currently have open onto the menu bar. With one click of the app icon, you can open the app straight from the menu bar.

It is highly recommended that you enable automatically hide and show the dock in system preferences. Now you have freed up all that space at the bottom of the screen where the dock used to always be showing, and you can open apps with your mouse by clicking their icon in the menu bar at the top!

If your computer suffers from lag when your activity gets more heavy and starts causing problems with switching apps, this is the perfect app for you.

While unhiding the dock to go to your app solves the problem of screen space, you must wait until it shows (if it even does show - often it doesn't due to lag), then look for the icon you want, then drag your mouse across the screen to click and open it. Who actually wants that???

While the Command+Tab shortcut can switch between your open apps in order, it requires one hand always on the keyboard, and can be laggy and take a while to show - by then you could have unhid the dock and found the app you want to click on manually! Time-wasting!

Hold command while dragging the icons to place them where you would like on the menu bar. It will reorder automatically once you change apps again.

You can change the number of apps shown, icon size and spacing, and sorting order in the app's preferences (accessed by right clicking on any of the app icons in the menu bar, then selecting Menu Bar Dock Preferences...). You can even set the app to launch at login automatically (Highly recommended)
